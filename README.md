> "My positionality was as not being marginal, but perhaps being part of a complex, dynamic, gorgeous, hard-fought, hard-earned, necessary and unfolding history." - Legacy Russell, [*On Footnotes*](https://www.veralistcenter.org/events/aica-usa-distinguished-critic-lecture-legacy-russell) [video lecture]

This site features a curriculum developed around the Principles of **C**ollective benefit, **A**uthority to control, **R**esponsibility, and **E**thics (CARE) and **F**indable, **A**ccessible, **I**nteroperable, and **R**eusable (FAIR) and how those priniciples apply to the different stages of the research data lifecycle.

The intent is for this website to be used as a supplement to teaching and understanding the research data lifecycle. It can be used formally or informally as a resource to critically engage with data in a way that can "actively protect, nurture, and respect the environments and communities embedded within datasets" [(CÌ§ay, Rodighiero & Zhang, 2025)][1].
