# Session 6 - Publish and Reuse

## Description

In fulfilling requirements for publishing and reuse, researchers much choose where to publish their findings and where their data and related documentation will live for others to reuse. Ensuring that your persistent identifiers (ORCID, DOI, etc.) – for yourself and your work – are included to make yourself and your data Findable and if your data belongs in a domain-specific, generalist, or institutional repository. Additional considerations include if it is feasible to share your data, that your data includes enough context to explain the origins of your data, and that you’ve done the work to prevent/mitigate misuse of your data. It is always important to remember that just because you have the ability to/capacity to share, it doesn’t mean you should.

## Questions

- Returning to the CARE Principles:
  - Is there a **Collective benefit** for sharing parts or all of your data?
  - Is there an agreement with the participants/communities/gatekeepers on the **Authority to control** where and how the data is shared? Are there any permissions or access restrictions? If so, what are they and how can they be accommodated?
  - How are you as the principal investigator/data collector/data analyst/curator **Responsible** once the data has been published and/or is shared/will be shared?
  - Is what (and how) you’re sharing **Ethical**? Are “best practices” and similar considerations enough?
