# Session 4 - Evaluate and Archive

> We further imagine a world where their narratives, whole or fragmented, are accessible to those who prioritize protection. [(King)][1]

## Description

As your research project concludes, you need to evaluate your data to ensure they are complete, accurate, and well-documented. Additionally, you will need to select where and how the data will be archived. While this is another opportunity to focus on the completeness of your data and related documentation, a focus should be placed to how you complete your data and documentation – looking to more inclusive description.

## Questions

 - From Montalvo (2023) “bad tats, jesus christ, lemons; everything is archival”
 - **NOTE:** all “questions to consider” for each section are valuable in considering what and how you archive your research data, particularly data about people/communities
   - what are your identities? how do you show up in this work?
   - who is your audience? what are their access needs?
   - what harms has the community you’re archiving faced?
   - what through lines from repair can be examined and subverted to power build in your context? 
- How can you provide enough metadata for your data that not only provides technical insight but also non-technical (historical, social, etc.) insight?
