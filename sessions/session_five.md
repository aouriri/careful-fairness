# Session 5 - Share and Disseminate

> Too often in science, we put the onus for ethical behavior on individuals, but an individual cannot ultimately behave ethically within an unethical framework - [Stephanie Russo Carroll (Dene/Ahtna)][1]

## Description

Once research is completed, many researchers look to share out their findings – many funding agencies and journals require it – and have to determine how much access to allow to others, certain agreements that satisfy institutional/organizational requirements, as well as proper stewardship of the research data. With the prevalence of AI and data concerning vulnerable populations, CARE and community-driven oversight of data helps narrow the [“moral distance”][2] that occurs when data is shared. While there are many benefits to data being Accessible, oceanographer and Native Hawaiian Rosie Alegado remarks, “‘Accessible’ means somebody can access it but you are still allowed to regulate it” (cited in Ravindran, 2024).  

## Questions

- How can a participant(s) and their data be protected from ways of sharing/reuse that are new or may not exist at the time of giving consent?
- Is it possible to reduce harm for individuals/communities while contributing to the greater benefit that may result from the research data?
- What does “openness” and “transparency” mean to you when considering sharing research data? Would the definitions change as the context of the research and the data changes?
