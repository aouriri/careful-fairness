## About

“I think the syllabus is a sort of instigation. It instigates and provokes a particular sort of behavior and encourages a particular sort of person.”

“The most precise thing I can say about the making of syllabi is this: a syllabus should in essence be a manifesto. It is a tattered flag that you wave. When a few sad souls have been drawn to you, then you begin the lessons.”

In the essay (of which the above quotes originate), [“On the Creation of Syllabi”](https://bombmagazine.org/articles/2017/08/16/on-the-creation-of-syllabi/), Jesse Ball doesn’t provide a simple definition of a syllabus or describe the general function of syllabi. Ball lays out the feelings that syllabi should evoke, if created well. In creating this syllabus, I thought back to the syllabi that I’ve encountered over the years as a curious formal and informal learner. Syllabi from classes I was taking, syllabi of courses that exist far from where I called home that I may never have the chance to take, and syllabi created by others who were just as curious and passionate about something. 
The syllabus created by my undergrad Philosophy instructor that used film to help students gain [“understanding of the major approaches to ethics.”](https://www.txst.edu/philosophy/resources/learning-outcomes.html) I wish I still had a copy, there were some amazing films on there. The [“Lemonade” Syllabus](https://www.joycerain.com/uploads/2/3/2/0/23207256/lemonade-syllabus.pdf), created by Candice Benbow and a host of others based on the themes in Beyoncé’s visual album of the same name. Dr. Alexander G. Weheliye’s [Afrofuturism (2014) syllabus](https://sites.google.com/site/alexweheliye/Syllabi/afrofuturism-2014?authuser=0) and others like it that include canonized creators/thinkers – Octavia Butler, Nalo Hopkinson, Sun Ra, Samuel Delaney, and George Clinton (as well as members under the Parliament-Funkadelic umbrella) – and also those who have inspired this philosophy.
I could go on and on about the power or maybe the satisfaction of expanding my way of thinking via syllabi. I don’t see a syllabus as simply an outline of the subjects in a course of study or teaching but a map that helps me navigate new worlds. This syllabus isn’t grounded in specific objectives or learning outcomes or does not include the various policies for which the student must abide by (I’m a non-faculty librarian without formal instruction responsibilities), but I hope that it helps with navigating the landscape of data, mainly research data, in a way that is communal, transparent, ethical, and inclusive, or at least, expands your view of the status quo of research data and the lifecycle.

This syllabus structure was inspired by Ashley Brewer's [*Halt and Catch Fire* Syllabus](https://bits.ashleyblewer.com/halt-and-catch-fire-syllabus/) found in Shannon Mattern's ["The Syllabus" Are.na channel](https://www.are.na/shannon-mattern/the-syllabus-p7j9cjyufoy).

## Questions

Instead of traditional assignments, projects, and testing, there are questions under each session that should engage the learner in thinking deeply and ethically about the complete research data lifecycle and the specifically, the different stages. Much of the material focuses on data about people and the environment, I believe that data creators/collectors, data users and reusers, can benefit from understanding "moral distance" and contextualizing data.
