# Session 7 – Store and Manage

## Description

While we’re at the end of the cycle, the storage and management of research data are constant process throughout the research project. Storage should be considered for both data/documentation in the active stage of the project and once the project is completed. The storage solution(s) may be different at each point. Same with how the data/documentation is managed. In this stage, we must think long term and regularly consider if the availability of the data is still of benefit years later and if adjustments must be made.

## Questions

- Who will manage the data at the conclusion of the project? Will participants or those immediately affected by the data have a say on how the data is managed after a certain point?
- Looking back to consent during the Create/Collect stage, will participants be made aware of the project’s retention policy?
- If not at the beginning of the research data management planning process, have the appropriate stakeholders been contacted to discuss and determine the procedures, rights and responsibilities at this stage of the lifecycle?
